# BoneSlicer
Repository for code related to the bone segmentation project in collaboration with Uni Stuttgart 

Python script that can be used with Blender on Mac, Linux and Microsoft. 

Automatic alignment of bone is attempted, however often manual adjustments need to be made. 

Running the script requires modifying the file path and file name to the bone in the script, marked by a comment in the code, ADJUST in all-caps. 

After this is done, the script can be run. 

To continue to the next step of the script whenever one is finished, press the SPACE bar. To reverse the numbering of the slices, press x. 

The data from the slices is also exported as a csv. 

The code is available under the GPL2 license and no guarantee is provided for the code.
